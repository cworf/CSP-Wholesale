You need the WooCommerce add-on if you need to:

*   Import XML to WooCommerce
*   Import CSV to WooCommerce
*   Are frustrated with the limitations of the official WooThemes Product CSV Import Suite

= WooCommerce CSV Imports =

Of course, XML files can have complex structures, but for CSV files, you can easily edit them and change the column names.

When importing CSV files, you should use UTF-8 encoding (which is very standard) if you are having any trouble with CSV imports containing special characters. But other than that, there are no special requirements.

This importer is the best option for WooCommerce CSV import tasks - our importer is extremely flexible when doing CSV imports because you don't need to edit your CSV files to import them to WooCommerce. WP All Import can import ANY CSV file to WooCommerce. You don't need to layout your data in a specific way, and you don't need your CSV to have specific column names. WP All Import's drag & drop interface provides you with a visual way to map the columns in your CSV file to the appropriate fields in WooCommerce.
